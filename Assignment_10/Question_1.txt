Are Higher Order functions and Call back functions the same ? If not,
briefly explain about both functions.

Higher-Order Functions(HoF) and Callback Functions(CB) are different.

Higher-Order Functions(HoF) : A function that takes another function(s) as an argument(s) and/or
returns a function as a value.

Callback Functions(CB) : A function that is passed to another function.
