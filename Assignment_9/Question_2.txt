Closure :
    Whenever you create a function within another function, then the inner function
    is closure. This closure is usuallyreturned so you can use the outer function’s variables at a later time.
    
Scope :
    Whereas a scope in JavaScript defines what variables you have access to. There are two kinds
    of scope – global scope and local scope.
