Is it possible to use async/await with promise chains ?

No.
Async/Await is used to work with promises in asynchronous functions. It is basically syntactic sugar for
promises. It is just a wrapper to restyle code and make promises easier to read and use. It makes asynchronous
code look more like synchronous/procedural code, which is easier to understand.



Can u handle async error without catch using promise ??

Async/await can handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors with just try/catch. On the other hand,
in promises we must add a catch handler on the promise chain to handle asynchronous errors. Omitting the
catch handler in our promise chain would make it impossible to handle asynchronous errors.
