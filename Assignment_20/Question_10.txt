In which scenarios would you use synchronous code instead of asynchronous code?

➤ Simplicity

Synchronous programming is well-supported amongst all programming languages. 

Developers do not have to worry about whether it is possible to code asynchronous applications as this
is the default. 

Plus, writing synchronous programs is objectively easier than writing asynchronous programs. 

In utilizing a blocking I/O architecture you can save time in the software development process and run
tests with fewer complications. 

➤ Marketing Potential 

Search engines find it easier to crawl for web pages that make use of traditional synchronous architecture. 

For marketers who depend on search engine optimization (SEO) to build their reputation and brand awareness,
this is an appreciable advantage. 

The more people who see your website via Google or Bing, the more visitors you’ll have on your webpage.
Naturally, this will positively affect your return on investment (ROI).
